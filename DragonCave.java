 * Dragon Cave Class:																				*
 * This class implements three methods that are defined within the class for displaying 			*
 * introduction, choosing a cave, and checking the selected cave, and also responsible for managing *
 * the interactions of users. The system informs a user that the user is in a land full of dragons, *
 * and number of caves. It gives the descriptions of a dragon in the cave. The user is give a 		*
 * chance to choose a cave. If the user's cave has a friendly dragon, it will share his treasure  	*
 * with the user otherwise, a greedy and hungry dragon will eat the user on sight.					*
